Sucle is a social network based on the location of users. Message can be shared with audio or video files attached. Message sent from a specific radius from the current user's location are shown. Each message can be commented by other users. The login process is done with a Facebook or a Google account.

The project was developed jointly with [Alexandre Perez](https://perezapp.ch/) and [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini).
