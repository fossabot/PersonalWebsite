ArcWork is a homework manager written in Ruby on Rails. It possesses all classical features of a homework manager. Teachers can assign homework to students, who can submit multiple versions and receive comments on them.

The project was realized as part of the web development course taught at Haute École Arc Ingénierie in Neuchâtel. Developed jointly with [Adrian Moll](https://ch.linkedin.com/pub/adrian-moll/86/341/b91) and [Etienne Frank](https://ch.linkedin.com/pub/etienne-frank/85/416/281/en).
