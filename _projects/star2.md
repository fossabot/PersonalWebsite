Star² is a planetarium software. It shows a current view of the sky at the current location. While is can be used with a keyboard and a mouse, full functionality needs a separate embedded system to point at stars. A [simulator](https://github.com/projetp1/P1-Android-BT-Simulator) was developed for Android, for people who don't have the separate pointer.

It was developed as a full year project during the first academic year of my Bachelor. It is a joint project with [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini), [Alexandre Perez](https://perezapp.ch), Loris Ceschin and Issa Barbier.
