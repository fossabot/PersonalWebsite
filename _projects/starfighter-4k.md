Starfighter 4K is a rendition of the Starfighter video game that we developed a year earlier. It is a Shoot-em-up game where two spaceships fight against each other in space.

With S4K, we added virtual reality by enabling control of the game with Kinect and Wiimotes at the same time. The game is best played projected to a wall. During development, the game proved to be very fun to play!

Further improvements were made in the menus (now controllable with Kinect and nicer) and in the gameplay.

The project was realized during the period between Academic years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 with [Alexandre Perez](https://perezapp.ch) and [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini).
