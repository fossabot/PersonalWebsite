The project was realized as part of the Advanced Software Engineering master course taught at the University of Fribourg. The [team](https://github.com/ase-15) consisted of [Thibaut Mauron](https://orstat.ch/), Ehsan Fahradi, [Alexandre Nikodemski](http://nikodemski.me/), Younos Cherkaoui, Numa de Montmollin and myself.

We implemented a Ruby on Rails application that communicates with the CyberCoach REST API. The work was managed using the Scrum methodology. We developed the project in a test-driven manner. We enforced good programming practices by defining different procedures. Certain practices were enforced by technical means, such as Git hooks.

We chose to build a gambling site where users can bet on boxing fights. As of the time of writing, a live demo is hosted on [Heroku](https://e-fightclub.herokuapp.com/).
