Project in progress. The goal is to implement a Ruby on Rails application that communicates with the CyberCoach REST API. A second goal is to organize the team work using the Scrum methodology.

We chose to build a gambling site where users can bet on boxing fights.

The project is realized as part of the Advanced Software Engineering course taught at the University of Fribourg.
