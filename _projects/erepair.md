The E-Repair project provides benefits for citizen of swiss municipalities regarding the repair of broken public objects. Using this application, a citizen may simply notify the municipality about a non-critical issue. For instance, a citizen may report a dead animal, a broken street lamp or bench, or malfunctioning traffic lights.

Using an application on their smartphone, citizens can notify the correct municipality (using GPS positioning) about a problem. The municipality can then treat the problem and notify the citizen about progression.

As part of this project, I developed the administrator's panel used by municipality employees.
