ProFitMap is a personal training companion that can track and compute statistics about sport performances. Every data is stored and seamlessly synchronized with the Dropbox cloud.

The application offers some unique features:

* **Ghost mode**: Shows a real-time comparison of the current run versus an earlier run set by the athlete or a friend.
* **Android beam sharing**: Enables easy sharing of runs by approaching phones (NFC communication).
* **Take pictures**: Picture can be taken during a run and then used as a thumbnail of it.
