The Figure Skating club in Yverdon needed a web platform to organize the distribution of courses over the available hours. We provided a system where people ask what they want, and the system figures out the best way to cope with everyone's needs.

The system was developed with Zend Framework 2. It was a joint project with [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini) and [Alexandre Perez](http://www.perezapp.ch).
