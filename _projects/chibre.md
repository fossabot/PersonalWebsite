Chibre is a traditional swiss card game played with 4 players around a table. C#ibre is essentially the game, albeit we virtualized the cards and the scores board. A Windows 8.1 tablet lies at the center of the table and displays cards played and the score board. Each player uses a phone or a small tablet in place of a hand of cards. To play a card, a player simply taps on the card it wants.

A WiFi connection is used to transmit instructions from/to the server (tablet)/clients (phones). The game gets simplified as only valid actions can be performed by players. Moreover, scores are automatically computed.

The project was developed jointly with [Diego Antognini](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diegoantognini) and [Alexandre Perez](https://perezapp.ch).
